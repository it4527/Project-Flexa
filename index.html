      <h2>The Capital City Of Bulgaria</h2>
      <p class="sofiaparag">Sofia is the capital of the Balkan nation of Bulgaria. It’s in the west of the country,
        below Vitosha Mountain. It is often re-routed by tourists who head to the coast or ski resorts,
        but miss something special. Sofia is not a great metropolis, but it is a modern, youthful city, with a
        scattering of onion-domed churches, Ottoman mosques and stubborn monuments of the Red Army that lend can
        convince you to hang around and explore further.
        The capital is full of beautiful parks that you can take a walk and relax in a pleasant air under the foot of
        vitosha mountain, which is close to the city of Sofia.

      <h2>Coat of arms of the capital of bulgaria</h2>
      <p class="sofiaparag">The coat of arms of Bulgaria consists of a crowned golden
        lion rampant over a dark red shield; above the shield is the Bulgarian historical crown. The shield is supported
        by two crowned golden lions rampant; below the shield there is compartment in the shape of oak twigs and white
        bands with the national motto "Unity makes strength" inscribed on them.
        Description:The current coat of arms of Bulgaria was adopted in 1997. The current arms are a slightly redesigned
        version of the coat of arms of Bulgaria from the period 1927–1946. Those arms were based on a similar earlier
        form, firstly used by Tsar Ferdinand I (1887–1918) as his personal ruler's coat of arms.The previous emblem,
        which combined the traditional gold lion rampant with the pattern of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union, was
        abandoned since Communist rule ended in the country in 1989.
