                Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is
                situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is
                surrounded by mountains on all sides. The valley is the largest in the country with territory of 1,186
                square kilometres (458 sq mi) and average altitude of 550 metres (1,800 ft). Three mountain passes lead
                to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, connecting the Adriatic Sea and Central Europe
                with the Black and Aegean Seas. A number of low rivers cross the city, including the Vladaiska and the
                Perlovska. The Iskar River in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. The city is known for its
                numerous mineral and thermal springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the last century.

                In Sofia, the summers are warm and mostly clear and the winters are very cold, snowy, and partly cloudy.
                Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 22째F to 83째F and is rarely below 10째F
                or above 93째F.
                Based on the tourism score, the best time of year to visit Sofia for warm-weather activities is from mid
                June to mid September.
