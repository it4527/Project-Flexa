            <p class="sofiaparag">
                Football is the most popular sport in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Sofia was the first city in the
                country to have an organized football championship, which was created in 1921. Teams from Sofia have
                been crowned national champions on 70 occasions in the 90 seasons between 1924 and 2013. As of the
                late 20th and early 21st centuries, there are four teams from Sofia which have been constant
                participants in the top national division – Levski, CSKA, Slavia and Lokomotiv. All four have managed
                to reach the latter stages of European competitions on several occasions, the best of which are CSKA's
                two European Cup semi-finals in 1967 and 1982, and Slavia's Cup Winners' Cup semi-final in 1967.
