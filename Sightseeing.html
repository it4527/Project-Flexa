            <h2>Statue of Saint Sofia</h2>
            <p class="sofiaparag">The Statue of Sofia is a recent addition, which was placed in the heart of the
                city in
                2001. At the junction between the main Tzum Mall and the Sheraton Hotel, it stands behind the
                Nedelja
                Church. It is a sculpture 24 feet high, made of bronze and copper. The statue weighs than 4 tons and
                is
                the creation of the Bulgarian artist Georgi Chapkanov and the architect Stanislav Konstantinov.
                Sofia
                has in her hands the symbols of fame and wisdom, and wears the crown of Tjuhe, the goddess of fate.
                Sophia is obviously the patron saint of the Bulgarian capital. Now crossing, where the statue
                stands, is
                undergoing

                Construction work and it does not do justice to thye sculpture , but it is a central neighborhood
                and
                when the work is finished it will certainly reappears as the emblem of the city.
