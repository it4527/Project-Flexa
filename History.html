            <h3>The History of City Sofia</h3>
            <p class="midBack">
                Sofia became capital of Bulgaria as recently as 1879, usurping the position from Veliko Tarnovo after
                six hundred years. Sofia was felt to possess a strategic location and the change of capital marked the
                end of Bulgaria’s dark ages under Ottoman rule. When it became capital, Sofia was a muddy,
                underdeveloped town of just 12,000 inhabitants, something akin to a large, open-air market. Writers talk
                of how the city’s inhabitants attended the first royal ball dressed in woollen socks and baggy Turkish
                pants.

                The city’s historic buildings date from the turn of the century up until the 1930s, when there was a
                rush to bring the city up to date and turn it into a modern European capital. Evidence has been found
                that Sofia was inhabited as early as 7000 years ago. Thracian and Roman remains can still be seen dotted
                around the city: in the underpass in front of the presidency; behind the Military Club, and behind the
                Sheraton hotel. Sofia’s thermal springs meant that it was always an attractive place for settlement.
                There are springs in the city center, Gorna Banya, Knyazhevo, Bankya and Ovcha Kupel.

            <p class="tracianBack">
                Under Thracian and later Roman rule Sofia was known as Serdika, from the middle of the 6th century the
                Byzantines renamed it Triaditsa and from the 9th century onwards during the First Bulgarian Kingdom it
                took on the Slavonic name of Sredets. The city finally became known as Sofia from the beginning of the
                15th century taking on the name Sofia, from St Sofia Church (wisdom). Sofia’s coat of arms was designed
                in 1900. The City’s motto “Raste no ne stare” (grows but does not age) was added a year later.

            <h3>Middle Ages </h3>
            <p class="midBack">
                Sofia first became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809, after a long
                siege. Afterwards, it was known by the Bulgarian name "Sredets" and grew into an important fortress and
                administrative centre. After the fall of North-Eastern Bulgaria under John I Tzimiskes' armies in 971,
                the
                Bulgarian Patriarch Damyan chose Sofia for his seat in the next year. After a number of unsuccessful
                sieges,
                the city fell to the Byzantine Empire in 1018, but once again was incorporated into the restored
                Bulgarian
                Empire at the time of Tsar Ivan Asen I.
                From the 12th to the 14th century, Sofia was a thriving centre of trade and crafts. It is possible that
                it had been called by the common population Sofia (meaning "wisdom" in Ancient Greek) about 1376 after
                the Church of St. Sofia. However, in different testimonies it was called both "Sofia" and "Sredets"
                until the end of the 19th century. In 1382, Sofia (Turkish: Sofya) was seized by the Ottoman Empire in
                the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars - after a long siege the city was captured with treason. The
                new name "Sofia" replaced the old one ("Sredets"), after the liberation of the city from Turkish rule in
                1878. Quite some time after 1878 there was a strong will, expressed by Bulgarian committees, to keep the
                name Sredets, but the Russian administration accepted Sofia.
